<a title="Google wave" href="http://wave.google.com/" target="_blank">Google wave</a> is an in-development project that blurs the distinction between email, instant messaging, blogs, etc. It is meant as an online communication and collaboration tool. To incorporate this technology in the way we do work, it would great if the tool allowed users to mark up pdfs or images. I am only half-way through the video so perhaps it already does.
