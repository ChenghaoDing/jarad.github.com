## Problem description

Samples of rock that contain gold (Au) and a number of other elements including 
calcium (Ca). Ca is censored into the range 10^-4 to 10^4 and samples are both
above and below this amount.

There is one drill hole with 500 samples within it. 

There are 49 predictors. 

Main question is the relationship between gold and each of the other elements.


## Consulting response

Ask a lot more questions about what the goal of the analysis is.
Possible approaches include principle components analysis, partial least 
squares, other variable selection approaches.
