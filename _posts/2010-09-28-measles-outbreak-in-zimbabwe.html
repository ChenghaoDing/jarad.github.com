Apparently<a title="Zimbabwe measles" href="http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Measles-kills-70-children-in-Zim-20100923" target="_blank"> there is an on-going outbreak of measles in Zimbabwe</a>. Here is <a title="Zimbabwe measles - WHO" href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/zwe/sitreps/24may_2june2010/en/index.html" target="_blank">some information</a> at the World Health Organization. According to the WHO, as of the 2nd of June, there have been 8173 cases and 517 deaths. (It is unclear to me where the first linked report of 70 deaths got their information.) In response to this outbreak, a nation-wide vaccination campaign was initiated in May and concluded on June 2nd after 5 million children were vaccinated. I have no idea how to get information post June 2nd, but I'd be curious about the current state of measles in Zimbabwe. Below is a map from <a title="Summary report" href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/zwe/sitreps/24may_2june2010/en/index.html" target="_blank">this WHO page</a> that I believe is from the May-June time frame, of course the legend is so small I can't even tell what the numbers are.
