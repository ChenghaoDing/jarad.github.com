My current verizon contract is up and although I get a discount for being a UCSB employee, I'm not sure I want to continue with verizon. I like the idea of a do-everything device such as an iPhone or an android phone. This <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/10/07/1133243/ATampT-To-Allow-VoIP-On-iPhone?from=rss">article</a> gives another reason to get an iPhone, namely AT&amp;T is going to allow VoIP over their data network. This would allow me to avoid the lack-of-minutes situation I am experiencing right now. (Tomorrow I will have all my minutes back.) My only hesitation here is that I would be doubling my monthly expense to get an iPhone plus data plan and I can't seem to justify it yet.
