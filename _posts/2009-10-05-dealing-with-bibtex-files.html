After reading <a href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/merging-bibtex-files/">this post</a> about merging bibTeX files, it reminded me of a program I used in the writing of my dissertation. The program, <a href="http://www.molspaces.com/cb2bib/">cb2Bib</a>, is a &ldquo;free, open source, and multiplatform application for rapidly extracting unformatted, or unstandardized bibliographic references from email alerts, journal Web pages, and PDF files.&rdquo; This program in addition to an institutional subscription to <a href="http://www.statindex.org/">statindex.org</a> helped tremendously in quickly incorporating references.
