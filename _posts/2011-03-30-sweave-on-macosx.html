Because it took me a while to figure this all out, I thought I would post it. The aim here is to create Sweave files in TeXShop with the ability to compile to a pdf in one click (or command-T [can't figure out how to insert the command symbol]). Here's what I did mainly thanks to <a title="Aaron Rendahl" href="http://www.stat.umn.edu/~arendahl/computing/index.html">Aaron Rendahl</a>.
<ol>
	<li>Save <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/scripts/Sweave.sh">Sweave.sh</a> into ~/Library/TeXShop/bin</li>
	<li>In terminal, type `chmod +x ~/Library/TeXShop/bin/Sweave.sh</li>
	<li>Create ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/Sweave.engine with the following content:
<blockquote>#!/bin/bash
~/Library/TeXShop/bin/Sweave.sh  -ld "$1"</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>In terminal, type `chmod +x ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/Sweave.engine'</li>
</ol>
If you want to also have an engine that doesn't clean up after itself, create ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/Sweave.engine with the following content:
<blockquote>#!/bin/bash
~/Library/TeXShop/bin/Sweave.sh  -nc -ld "$1"</blockquote>
and in terminal typing `chmod +x ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/SweaveNoClean.engine'.

Now, if you don't want to include Sweave.sty in every directory where you are creating a Sweave document, just do the following obtained from <a title="Code snippet" href="http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/1972">here</a>:
<ol>
	<li>In terminal type, `mkdir -p ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex'</li>
	<li>In terminal type, `cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex'</li>
	<li>In terminal type, `ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share/texmf Sweave'</li>
</ol>
