For those who read this blog, I'm sure you realize the content doesn't appear as quickly as on most blogs. After a year or so of having this blog, I realize the effort it takes even to have just a half-thought idea to post about. I still like having the blog, but my original goal of a post a day is just unreasonable.

I found out that <a href="http://www.significancemagazine.com">Significance Magazine</a> (a new joint venture of the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Association) requested applications for a news editor. Not really knowing what this meant, I sent in a couple of articles from my blog postings last year. Apparently they were impressed or at least in desperate need of news editors and they invited me on board. My first posting there is about using Bayes' rule to <a href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/870031/Vaccination-by-religion.html">determine vaccination rates by religion in Zimbabwe</a>. Hope you enjoy!
