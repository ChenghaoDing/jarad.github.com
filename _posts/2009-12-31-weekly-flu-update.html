The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided its week 50 update (week ending Dec 19, 2009). Current link is <a title="CDC weekly" href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/" target="_blank">here</a> and the permanent link is <a title="CDC week 50 2009 flu update " href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2009-2010/weekly50.htm" target="_blank">here</a> (current link will be incorrect once week 51 update is available at which point the permanent link will be correct). The overall influenza trend is still decreasing and is almost entirely H1N1. <a title="Google flu trends" href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/us/" target="_blank">Google echoes this trend</a>. I am still waiting to see if a second outbreak of non-H1N1 will occur.
