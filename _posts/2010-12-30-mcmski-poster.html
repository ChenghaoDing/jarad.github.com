It appears <a title="Xian MCMSki poster" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/poster-at-mcmski-iii/" target="_blank">others</a> are posting their MCMSki III posters on their blogs, so I thought I would follow suit. This poster is based on work by me and Matt Wheeler to perform Bayesian inference in stochastic chemical kinetic models on a general purpose graphical processing unit.
