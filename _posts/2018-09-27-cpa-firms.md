## Problem description

CPA firms in one of 3 industry groupings: big4, national, and regional.
Each row has a dichotomous measure of IT complexity: low and high
as well as an ordinal response 1-7. 

Firms may exist in the data set multiple times indicating aspects of the firms,
but no indication is provided in the data set about which lines correspond
to the same company. 

Question of interest is if there are interactions between IT complexity and 
firm size in ordinal response. 

Can we use a nonparametric method?

## Consulting response

We are concerned about the lack of information in the data for which rows
correspond to which companies. 

With an ordinal response (which is essentially a rank transformation of the
underlying "response"), it is unclear what an interaction means.

Possibly use an ordinal regression method.
