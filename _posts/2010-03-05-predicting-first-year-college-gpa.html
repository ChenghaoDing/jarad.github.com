The data consists n = 2638 points of information of first year college GPA (FYGPA), high school GPA (HSGPA), SAT scores (SATCR, SATM, and SATW), and Income for college-bound high school seniors.  The data is divided into 12 years starting from 1997 and ending at 2008.  Each data point corresponds to a self-reported, particular value for a particular student.  No violation of normality was found for all variables except Income.  Dynamic regression will be estimated predicting FYGPA from HSGPA and SAT’s.  My prediction (95% interval) that in year 2010, for a student who scored 500 on each of the SAT’s and had HSGPA = 3.5, FYGPA will be equal to 2.43.
