My model finally includes local level component and seasonal component. The period of seasonal compenent is 52 weeks, because every year there are periodic transportation peaks which lead to a high demand of gasoline. I use two harmonics in the model, due to the fact in my <a href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2010/03/07/california-regular-retail-gasoline-price-forecast/">previous post</a>previous post that there are overall two peaks for summer and winter. Some rare events such as economic ressesion, are considered as random noise. Based on my model, forecast (95% interval) of regular all formulations retail gasoline price in week 515 (Mar 29 2010 which is 5 week after last observation) and week 540 (Sep 20 2010 which is 30 weeks after last observation) is 319.1046 (285.5028, 356.6612), and 319.7633 (244.3232, 418.4972).
