I a [comment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0189-z) 
was published in Nature Human Behavior that suggested lowering
the pvalue threshold from 0.05 to 0.005. 
Subsequent discussion has occurred on 
[Andrew Gelman's blog](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/10/02/response-comments-abandon-statistical-significance/)
and in an associated 
[paper](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)
that suggests we need to remove null hypothesis significance testing
from its gatekeeper role in science, 
i.e. papers can only get published if they have a pvalue of less than 0.05.

My opinion is much more in line with the discussion and paper on Gelman's 
blog. 
I often tell students of my entry into statistics where I came from being
a research engineer and a lab tech in a fruit fly genetics lab to wanting to
obtain a master's degree in statistics so that 
"I would know exactly how to analyze any type of data set."
I quickly realized the statistics world was much bigger than I realized 
and that statistics is not a black-and-white process. 
Similarly, I discourage colleagues and students from asking what is the 
"right" analysis? to asking what analysis can answer my scientific questions
of interest. 

I believe we teach statistics students a process that suggests there is one
correct way to analyze a data set and one and only one result from that 
analysis that is scientifically meaningful. 
The implicit suggestion here is that every data set as a single method of 
analysis and that if the result isn't scientifically meaningful then it 
should be thrown in the trash. 
In my opinion, this education process has led partially, if not wholly, to 
the current issue in science of replicability.

In my opinion, we need to start teaching students what the results of a 
statistical analysis really mean and get them away from thinking of a 
significant pvalue as the ultimate result of the scientific process.
To pass the buck slightly down the road, 
in order for students to truly understand what the results mean they typically
need to have a stronger mathematical background than they currently have.
So let's work toward boosting the mathematical capability of all students
toward the goal of improving their ability to interpret science.
