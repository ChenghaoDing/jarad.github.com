<a title="First student post on aguanomics" href="http://aguanomics.com/2009/10/hong-kong-taxinomics.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a post by a student in EEP100 at Berkeley on the <a title="Aguanomics" href="http://aguanomics.com/" target="_blank">aguanomics</a> blog. This is the first of a series of posts by students.

I'm considering implementing this for my PSTAT 262MC class on Applied Bayesian Time Series. My thought is to require students to post twice during the quarter. The first post will try to forecast a time series using just intuition, i.e. no math/stats. The second post will try to forecast a time series (possibly the same one) using a statistical model based approach.

Any thoughts?
