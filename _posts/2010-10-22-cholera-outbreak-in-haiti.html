From <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11608551">this news source</a>, I learned there is a cholera outbreak in Haiti. <a href="http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml">My RSS feed for BBC world news</a>, says that at least 135 people have died from the disease, whereas <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11599777">this BBC article from yesterday</a> says that only 50 people have died. Perhaps they found the other 85 people in the course of one day, but that seems doubtful.

And why does the World Health Organization not have this <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/country/hti/en/">Haiti cholera outbreak</a> up yet?
