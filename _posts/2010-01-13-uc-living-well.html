This was a statement I had to agree to take an online health assessment through my health insurance. Since this is a completely voluntary action and because it involves potentially sensitive information, I am okay with having to agree to something. Of course, I still haven't read it, so I really have no idea what I'm agree to.

COPYRIGHT, PRIVACY AND LEGAL INFORMATION

ACCESS TO THIS INTERNET SITE IS OFFERED TO YOU CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE, WITHOUT MODIFICATION, OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES:

Copyright and Trademark Notice

All rights are reserved by StayWell, and no material on this site may be reproduced, modified, used in a derivative work, downloaded, disseminated, displayed, published, reposted or transferred in any form or by any means, except with the prior written permission of, and express attribution to, StayWell. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an authorized user may download, but may not make any other use or distribution of, a single copy of material on this site for the authorized user's own personal, non-commercial use only, provided that the authorized user does not remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from the material.

Privacy---How StayWell Uses Your Information

StayWell believes that the confidentiality between StayWell and the participant is the cornerstone of a program’s success and respects and protects the participant’s privacy as an authorized user of StayWell Online.

Use of Information by StayWell
StayWell collects personally identifiable information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, your employee or unique identification number, your date of birth, and your answers to the health assessment questions (your "Personal Information"). Your Personal Information is used by StayWell or by another service provider engaged by StayWell to provide health management services to you, which includes using the Personal Information to inform you of relevant health improvement programs offered by StayWell. Also, in the event that StayWell's services are transitioned to another service provider, StayWell may deliver your Personal Information to the successor provider in an effort to maintain a continuity of services for you. StayWell will never sell your Personal Information and will not otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information to any third party except in accordance with this statement, to the extent authorized by you, or to comply with applicable law or valid legal process.

Sharing Information with the University
The University of California ("UC") will never receive personally identifiable information about you from StayWell. UC will receive only de-identified information about the program as a whole. That de-identified or summary information will be used by UC for the purposes of reporting, research, and/or wellness program planning.

Sharing Information with Your Health Plan or other Service Provider
You have the option to decide whether or not to allow StayWell to share your Personal Information with your Health Plan. You can exercise this option by indicating your preference in the last question in the Health Assessment survey.

If you agree to have your Personal Information (including the results of your Health Assessment) shared with your Health Plan, the Health Plan may reach out to you to make you aware of programs it offers that fit your situation. If you agree to have your Personal Information shared with your Health Plan, and UC contracts with separate vendor to provide disease management or related services in place of the Health Plan, your Personal Information may also be shared with that vendor. The same privacy requirements that apply to Personal Information shared with your Health Plan will apply to Personal Information shared with a separate vendor.

UC requires its Health Plans to comply with required privacy and confidentiality agreements; your Personal Information is to be treated with the same confidentiality as your personal claim record and other private information held by your Health Plan. The Health Plans are not permitted to use this information to increase your coverage costs, limit your coverage, or restrict you from all the benefits and opportunities you would otherwise have, while you are with UC or even after you leave employment at UC.

If you do not want StayWell to share your Personal Information with your Health Plan, simply indicate this in response to the final Health Assessment question and your data will not be shared.

Your participation in the StayWell programs and your use of the online tools offered by StayWell is completely voluntary. At any time, you may opt not to provide StayWell with the requested Personal Information. If you opt not to provide certain Personal Information, you understand that you may not be able to use or access some of the StayWell programs and tools. Also, please be aware that withholding certain Personal Information may affect the ability of the program or tool to provide relevant information to you.

Incentives and Research
In order to distribute any program incentives to you, StayWell may provide your name and/or employee identification number to StayWell’s incentive vendor to notify them of the fact that you have completed the health assessment and are eligible for the incentive. StayWell may also use your Personal Information as part of group statistical research and analysis. UC and its agents may only use de-identified information as part of any research they may perform.

Serious Threat to Health or Safety
If you threaten to harm yourself in any way, including suicide, StayWell is authorized to disclose your Personal Information, including relevant protected health information, as it deems advisable. If you communicate a threat of violence against an identifiable potential victim(s), StayWell may communicate the threat to the potential victim(s) and/or law enforcement agency.

Abuse or Neglect
StayWell may disclose your Personal Information, and any other relevant protected health information, as it deems advisable to report suspected abuse or neglect of a child (born or unborn) or vulnerable adult to the appropriate authorities.
Participant Rights

You have the Right to be Treated with Respect
As a participant, you have the right to be treated courteously and respectfully by StayWell and to receive services that (i) respect your privacy and dignity, (ii) assist you in the development of a wellness plan that helps you achieve your defined goals, and (iii) do not discriminate against you, regardless of you ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, age, marital status, or sexual orientation.

No Marketing or Advertising
StayWell does not accept any advertising on StayWell Online, and StayWell does not receive income from marketing sponsors or advertisers. Any mention of a particular service is not an endorsement, but rather mentioned to you so that you will be aware of programs for which you are eligible.
