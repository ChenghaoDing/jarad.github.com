It seems that as I've already agreed to the Software license terms for the original Windows Vista, this seems excessive.

<blockquote>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
WINDOWS VISTA SERVICE PACK 2
Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this supplement to you.  If you are licensed to use Windows Vista (the “software”), you may use this supplement. You may not use it if you do not have a license for the software.  You may use a copy of this supplement with each validly licensed copy of the software.
The following license terms describe additional terms for the software.  These terms and the license terms for the software apply to your use of the supplement. If there is a conflict, these supplemental license terms apply. The changes include:
·	additional privacy disclosures about Internet-based services
·	proof of license for the software
This list highlights some of the changes. The terms below govern your use of the software.
By using this supplement, you accept these terms.  If you do not accept them, do not use this supplement.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
1.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software.  It may change or cancel them at any time. The following are in addition to the Windows Vista license terms.

a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services.  The software features described below and in the Windows Vista Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet.  In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect.  You may switch off these features or not use them.  For more information about these features, see the Windows Vista Privacy Statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=96553.  By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information.  Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

Computer Information.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software.  Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

·	Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions.  You may connect new hardware to your device, with directly or over a network.  Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware.  If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your device.  An administrator can disable this update feature. 

·	Malicious Software Removal.  During setup of the software, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the software may check for and remove certain malicious software (“Malware”) from your device during setup.  The Malware that will be removed, if found, is listed and periodically updated at http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. When the software checks your device for Malware, a report will be sent to Microsoft about any Malware detected, specific information relating to the detection, errors that occurred while the software was checking for Malware, and other information about your device that will help us improve this and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.

·	Network Awareness.  This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries.  The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes.  You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.

2.	PROOF OF LICENSE.
Proof of License for Online Purchase of Electronic Download Software.  If you purchased and downloaded the software online from Microsoft, the information in your purchase confirmation email is your proof of license.  You may access your license information using your Windows Live ID to access your account on the Microsoft Store
