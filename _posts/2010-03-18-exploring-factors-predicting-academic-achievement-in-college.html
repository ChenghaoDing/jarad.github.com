Exploring Factors Predicting Academic Achievement in College

To predict first year college GPA (FYGPA) in college-bound senior, a dynamic regression model was constructed where dependent series were FYGPA and independent series contained three SAT scores (Critical Reading, Math, and Writing) and high school GPA (HSGPA).  Due to the structure of the data, mean value instead of the actual values for each variable was extracted at each time point and used in the analysis.  The model presumed not to have linear trend or seasonality. A plot of two series (Yt and Xt) against time are presented in <a href="https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/assignment/view.php?id=89781">Blog 1</a>.  The nature of the data seems to support a simple, straight line regression where Î¸t represents the regression parameter vector.  A one-step forecast is presented in the attached file.
