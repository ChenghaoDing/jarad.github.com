<a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2012/05/picture-of-the-day-outlier.html" target="_blank">Environmental economics has a post</a> showing that Ohio State University (OSU) is an outlier when you plot the average full professor compensation versus the university president's compensation. I'm not sure this seems like a reasonable plot to make perhaps instead plot total full professor compensation versus president compensation. The rationale here is that a larger university should on average pay its president more, but by using average professor compensation the size of the university is eliminated as an explanatory variable. OSU is a large university and therefore would be expected to pay its president quite a bit. With that being said, $2M seems like a lot for a college president.
