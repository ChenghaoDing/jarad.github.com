Having just moved to the state of California and having previously lived in a state where Jesse "the Body" Ventura used to be governor, I am severely disappointed with our governor and this veto letter. Perhaps, just maybe, the governor would have more cooperation with the legislature if he didn't treat them with such disrespect.<img class="aligncenter" title="Governor Schwarzeneggers Fuck You letter" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/10/1027fu.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="328" />
