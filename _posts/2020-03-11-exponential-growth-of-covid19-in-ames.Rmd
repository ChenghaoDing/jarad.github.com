[Liz Specht](https://twitter.com/LizSpecht) offers an 
[analysis](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) 
to look at how quickly hospital beds will fill up in due to severe COVID19
symptoms. Let's perform this analysis for Ames. 

## Base assumptions

The 
[assumptions](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) here are that there will be a 

  - doubling of individuals with COVID19 every 6 days,
  - 10% of those individuals will need hospitalization, and
  - hospitalization lasts 3-6 weeks.
  
The 
[details for Ames, IA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames,_Iowa#2010_census) 
are that 

  - population is 65,000
  - and 1 individual is sick today.
  

  
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
date = Sys.Date()
total = 1
hospitalized = 0
for (i in 2:13) {
  date[i] <- date[i-1]+6
  total[i] = total[i-1] * 2
  hospitalized[i] = round(total[i]*0.1)
}
d <- data.frame(date = date,
                total = total,
                hospitalized = hospitalized)
ggplot(d %>% 
         pivot_longer(-date, 
                      names_to = "category", values_to = "count"), 
       aes(date, count, color=category)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 220) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 220*0.3, linetype = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Expected COVID19 cases in Ames, IA if 1 is sick on 11 Mar 2020") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 500)) +
  theme_bw()
```

As Liz Specht suggested, 
if only 30% of beds are available in Ames then we run out of beds around 
May 6th. 
If all beds are available, we run out of beds around May 15th. 
If some of these assumptions are off, we run out of beds a week before or a 
week after these numbers. 

We need to do everything we can to [flatten the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/).
