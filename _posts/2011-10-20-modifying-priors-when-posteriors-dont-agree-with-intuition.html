I'm a big fan of <a title="Andrew Gelman blog" href="http://andrewgelman.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Gelman</a>, but the quote below from a <a title="Half-Cauchy priors for hierarchical variance parameters" href="http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue03/gelman.pdf" target="_blank">2006 article</a> worries me
<blockquote>Â We view any noninformative or weakly-informative prior distribution as inherently
provisional--after the model has been fit, one should look at the posterior distribution
and see if it makes sense. If the posterior distribution does not make sense, this implies
that additional prior knowledge is available that has not been included in the model,
and that contradicts the assumptions of the prior distribution that has been used. It is
then appropriate to go back and alter the prior distribution to be more consistent with
this external knowledge.</blockquote>
Isn't this exactly the potential problem that fuels anti-Bayesian sentiment?
