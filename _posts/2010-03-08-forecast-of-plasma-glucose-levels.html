Blood glucose levels over three periods of 7 days were collected from 86 insulin-dependent individuals and analyzed to provide insight on diabetes management, with respect to insulin dosing.  Transcutaneous sensors, which were inserted in the abdominal region, collected glycated glucose level information every 5 minutes, for 7 days.  This information was initially masked during the first period, but later revealed to the subjects.  The figure below shows hourly blood glucose levels for a patient over a period of one week.  My forecast (95% interval) for plasma blood glucose levels at 3 AM and 6 PM are 150 and 200, respectively.
