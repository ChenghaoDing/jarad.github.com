All I was trying to do was update the driver for an HP Photosmart 8450 printer. The CD with drivers has been lost so I had to search. Googling for an answer brought me to a site (hp.com) that said it had the driver I needed. What I actually ended up downloading was an exe file which presumably updates the necessary drivers. But why do I need to agree to the terms just to get a driver for a product I already have?
