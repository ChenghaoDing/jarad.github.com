Previously I discussed the <a title="QMSS post" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/05/qmss-ucsb/" target="_blank">Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences</a> program here at UCSB. I am now a core faculty member of this program as can be seen <a title="QMSS participants" href="http://www.qmss.ucsb.edu/participants.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This means I can serve as a QMSS advisor, although students can probably get more information by visiting the <a title="QMSS curriculum" href="http://www.qmss.ucsb.edu/curriculum.html" target="_blank">QMSS curriculum page</a>. I can also be the outside representative on a QMSS student's dissertation committee which is a requirement for the QMSS program. So I hope students start knocking down my door, although I'll be happy if one shows up.
