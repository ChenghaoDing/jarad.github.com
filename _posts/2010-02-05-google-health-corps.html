If I were a recent college grad (and especially if job prospects were looking slim), I would think about entering the <a title="Google health corps" href="http://blog.google.org/2010/02/applications-now-open-for-2010-2011.html" target="_blank">Google Health Corps</a>.From the link:
<blockquote>GHC is a unique program that enhances a fellow's cultural experience by pairing cross cultural teams - one fellow from the host country and one international fellow. Once accepted, all chosen fellows must complete a summer training course sponsored by <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. This year GHC has 32 open positions with locations ranging from Burundi, Rwanda, New Jersey, Malawi, and Massachusetts. We believe that Global Health Corps offers a unique experience that enables young professionals to gain valuable experience for strengthening global public health equity.</blockquote>
