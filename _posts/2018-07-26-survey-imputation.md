## Problem description

National survey lots of missing values. 
In particular the response has 82% missingness and explanatory variables
range from almost complete to around the same level of missingness.
How can we impute the missing values?

## Consulting response

### Questions

- How was the data gathered? Simple random sample? Stratified?
- Why are you interested in doing imputation?

### Comments

- 82% seems like a lot of missingness, especially in the response
- The client will likely need to get comfortable with missing data approaches.
