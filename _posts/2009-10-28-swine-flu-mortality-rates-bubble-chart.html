Andrew Gelman over at his <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/mlm/" target="_blank">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a> blog often brings up figures that he thinks are good, bad, and ugly. I would like to continue that tradition here. I saw the figure below on Barry Ritholtz's <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog" target="_blank">The Big Picture</a> blog. Now, Barry's blog has nothing to do with statistics or swine flu, but since everybody is interested in swine flu these days, he decided to put this figure on his blog. From a probabilistic perspective, the point of the figure is very clear, <em>conditional on having the disease what is the probability of dying from it</em>. I would be very interested in this quantity if I had the disease, but since I don't have any of these diseases (that I am aware of), I don't care. The quantity I'm interested in is my marginal probability of dying from the disease. (Certainly I would prefer a conditional probability where we condition on my age, gender, geographical location, etc, but that is asking a bit much). So although this is an interesting and colorful figure, it has no relevance (yet) to my situation, although I will be happy to know that my chances of surviving swine flu once I get it are pretty good.

Separately, why is the subtitle "Average % of infected who die"? Shouldn't it just be `% of infected who die'?
