Seriously, I need to sign a term of service to get on a help forum???? Aren't I provided free testing service by reporting issues or responding to them?

<blockquote>Google Help Forum Terms of Service

Welcome to Google Help Forum! Before you begin using Google Help Forum, you must read and agree to these Google Help Forum Terms of Service ("Terms of Service") and the following terms and conditions and policies, including any future amendments (collectively, the "Agreement"):

    * Google Terms of Service - Google's general terms and conditions (http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html)

Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version at http://www.google.com/support/forum/tos. Google may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. If you do not accept and abide by this Agreement, you may not use Google Help Forum. In the event of an inconsistency between the Google Help Forum Terms of Service and either Google's general Terms of Service http://www.google.com/intl/en/terms_of_service.html) or the Google Privacy Policy (http://www.google.com/privacy.html), the Google Help Forum Terms of Service shall control.
