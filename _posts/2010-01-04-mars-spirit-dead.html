I am currently reading Roving Mars by Steve Squyres, a <a title="Steve Squyres" href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/people/facstaff-detail.php?pers_id=112" target="_blank">professor of astronomy</a> at Cornell University. (In all honesty I am actually listening to the book on CD, which is a great way to pass the time driving around MN). So it is a timely coincidence that Mars Spirit is in the news. The original mission design for Mars Spirit called for a 3-month lifetime. After almost 6 years, it <a title="Mars spirit" href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/3217/end-road-nasas-mars-rover" target="_blank">appears</a> that Mars Spirit might finally end its mission. Its tragic fate? Getting stuck in the sand. Even in its precarious position, Spirit has made a new discovery finding sulfates within its sand trap. So please, raise a glass for Mars Spirit.
