When teaching courses it is often nice to have data sets for us in lectures or for homework or projects. I decided I will use my blog as a resource to help me (and anybody else who reads this blog) organize and find data sets. The most recent <a title="Datasets" href="http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/dunn/Datasets/index.html" target="_blank">database of datasets</a> I have found is by <a title="Peter Dunn" href="http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/dunn/Datasets/index.html" target="_blank">Peter Dunn</a>. These datasets are split up by categories: datasets from books, glms, application, and reported statistics. Of particular interest to me currently is the availability data sets useful for PSTAT 220B - Generalized Linear Models.
