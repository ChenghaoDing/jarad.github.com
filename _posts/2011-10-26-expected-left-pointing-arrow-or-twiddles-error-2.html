<a title="expected left pointing arrow or twiddles error" href="http://jaradniemi.com/2011/10/07/expected-left-pointing-arrow-or-twiddles-error/">Previously</a> this error was caused by not putting in the brackets for a vector, e.g. v[]. This time the error was caused by trying to include an if statement which is not supported by OpenBUGS. (At least as far as I can gather from the <a title="WinBUGS FAQ" href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/faqs/contents.shtml#q15" target="_blank">WinBUGS FAQ</a>.
