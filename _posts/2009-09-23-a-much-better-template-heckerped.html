This template looks promising. I found it at <a title="imJTk.com" href="http://imjtk.com/" target="_blank">http://imjtk.com/</a> as a free template. The downsides are the first two links under blogroll and the attribution. Apparently for $35 I can get rid of these, but I think I will wait a bit longer to see if I like this template over all. One upside is that the header images seem easy to modify, but I don't have to worry about that initially since I actually like the images (except for the one I already deleted).
