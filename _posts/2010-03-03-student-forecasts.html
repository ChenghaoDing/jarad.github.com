<a title="Student blogging suggestion" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/02/student-blogging/" target="_self">Having heard no complains when I suggested it</a>, I have adopted an<a title="Here they come" href="http://aguanomics.com/2009/10/here-they-come.html" target="_blank"> idea</a> stolen from David Zetland's <a title="Aguanomics" href="http://aguanomics.com/" target="_blank">aguanomics blog</a>. For the next two weeks, you will see blog posts from students in PSTAT 262MC, Applied Bayesian Time Series. The assignment consists of two blog posts. Each student's first post will introduce a data set and provide forecasts for two future time points. The second post will describe the model used to analyze the data set as well as model predictions for those same two time points. Following aguanomics, their grade will be based solely on submission and not on quality. I welcome constructive comments from my readers (however few there are).
