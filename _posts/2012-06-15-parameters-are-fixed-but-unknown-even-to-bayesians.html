When I was introduced to Bayesian statistics, I heard the phrase: "for Bayesians, parameters are random". I took this at face value for years even though I didn't believe it. Instead, I thought of parameters as fixed, but our uncertainty about their value assigned a probability distribution. I was happy to find this <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5366v4" title="arXiv" target="_blank">arXiv article</a> to be published as a discussion paper in <a href="http://amstat.tandfonline.com/loi/tas" title="The American Statistician" target="_blank">The American Statistician</a> that states "Actually, for Bayesians as much as any other statistician, parameters are fixed but unknown. It is the knowledge about these unknowns that Bayesians model as random." 

On a different note, I still don't understand the doomsday argument discussed in the paper.
