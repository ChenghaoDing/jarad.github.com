[Liz Specht](https://twitter.com/LizSpecht) offers an 
[analysis](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) 
to look at how quickly hospital beds will fill up in the US due to severe 
COVID19 symptoms. Let's perform this analysis for Ames. 

## Base assumptions

The 
[assumptions](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) here are that there will be a 

  - doubling of individuals with COVID19 every 6 days,
  - 10% of those individuals will need hospitalization, and
  - hospitalization lasts 3-6 weeks.
  
The details for Ames, IA are that 

  - [population is 65,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames,_Iowa#2010_census), 
  - [Mary Greeley Medical Center has 220 beds](https://www.mgmc.org/), and 
  - 1 individual is sick today (11 March 2020).
  
To be clear, I have no evidence to support that somebody in Ames already has 
COVID19, but people are coming back from international travel 
and Iowa does have 
[13 presumptive positive cases](https://idph.iowa.gov/Emerging-Health-Issues/Novel-Coronavirus), 
most stemming from a single cruise.

As Liz Specht suggested, 
if only 30% of beds are available in Ames then we run out of beds around 
May 6th. 
If all beds are available, we run out of beds around May 15th. 
If some of these assumptions are off, we run out of hospital beds a couple of 
weeks before or after these predictions.

We need to do everything we can to [flatten the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/).
