I read the <a title="Calculated Risk Blog" href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/" target="_blank">Calculated Risk blog</a> and they often post <a title="Recent bank failures" href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/01/bank-failure-4-to-6-in-2011.html" target="_blank">the most recent bank failures</a>. It got me to wondering whether the bank failure rate is still on the rise or is finally decreasing. I decide to look up the data and it was surprisingly easy to find as a <a title="Bank Failure csv file" href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.csv" target="_blank">csv</a> downloadable from this <a title="FDIC Bank Failure LIst" href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html" target="_blank">FDIC page</a> (a big shout-out to the FDIC for making this data so easily obtainable!). Below is a figure of the FDIC insured bank failures all the way back to about 2000. Clearly observed is the calm before the storm of 2008. I will be trying to keep this updated while I also improve the figure for readability, but for now...this is what you get.
