The 2010 US News &amp; World Report is out for graduate school rankings. In the statistics category, <a title="US News &amp; World Reprot" href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-statistics-schools/rankings/page+3" target="_blank">UCSB is ranked 55th</a> in the country with a composite score of 2.5 (the top school had 4.9). This is the ranking for graduate schools as I surmised by the URL, so clearly we have some work to improve our ranking in that category.

It is nice to see that statistics has its own category within Science schools.
