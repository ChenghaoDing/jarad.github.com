First I had to agree to the <a title="myGarmin terms and conditions" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/12/13/garmin-terms-and-conditions/>myGarmin terms and conditions</a>, then I had to agree to the <a title="Garmin communicator plug-in agreement" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/12/13/garmin-communicator-agreement/">Garmin communicator plug-in agreement</a>, and now I have to agree to the Garmin software license agreement.
