While reading Christian Robert's blog <a title="Valencia 9 highlights" href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/comments-for-valencia-9/" target="_blank">highlighting some of the discussion of the invited program for Valencia 9</a>, I realized that the <a title="Valencia 9 program" href="http://www.bayesian.org/events/valencia/valenciam.html" target="_blank">entire invited program</a> was available on the Valencia website. For anybody who is interested in the cutting-edge of Bayesian statistics, this meeting is the premiere source and it is great to have free online access to the publications on the Valencia website.

In particular I'd like to highlight <a title="Mark Huber's homepage" href="http://www.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/MHuber/" target="_blank">Mark Huber</a>'s paper entitled <a title="TPA paper" href="http://www.uv.es/bernardo/Huber.pdf" target="_blank">Using TPA for Bayesian inference</a>. I highlight it not because it is a brilliant paper, although it might be....Mark is certainly brilliant, but instead because TPA in the title stands for `Tootsie Pop Algorithm.' I kid you not. Crazy Bayesians!
