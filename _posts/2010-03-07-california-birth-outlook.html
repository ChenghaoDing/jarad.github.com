Annual live births for the state of <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/VSC-2008-0201.pdf"><i>California</i></a> were analyzed. The data were recorded on an annual basis for the years 1960 through 2008, with no missing observations. Throughout this period, there is evidence of three birth "booms" - one from the late 1960's until 1970, a large "boom" from the mid 1970's until 1990, and lastly, one from the late 1990's through 2007. Overall, the number of live births in California has increased by nearly twenty thousand from the recorded level in 1960. The last recorded observation indicates that a downward trend in state-wide births may be beginning. Preliminary evidence appears to support this hypothesis; however, there is a high likelihood that the state will soon experience another "boom" in births, as those children born during the beginning portion of the large "boom" of the mid 1970's  through 1990 are now of peak child-bearing age.
