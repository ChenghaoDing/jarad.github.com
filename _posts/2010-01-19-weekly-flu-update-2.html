It has been a while since I last had a <a title="Previous weekly flu update" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/12/31/weekly-flu-update/" target="_self">weekly flu update post</a>. Mainly this is because all is pretty quiet on the flu front. Last week gave a momentary uptick that suggested a possible second epidemic peak, but this week's data does not agree. The <a title="Flu weekly" href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/" target="_blank">week 1 data</a> (possible <a title="Week 1 2009-2010" href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2009-2010/weekly01.htm" target="_blank">permalink</a>) tested only 3,886 specimens of which only 139 were positive for influenza. Of these, 78 were H1N1 while another 59 had no sub-typing available (a possible maximum of 137). I'm still waiting for that second epidemic peak, but will be happy if it never materializes.
