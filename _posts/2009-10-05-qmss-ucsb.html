To all Ph.D. students at the <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, please check out the <a href="http://www.qmss.ucsb.edu/">quantitative methods in the social sciences</a> (QMSS) program. From the website:
<blockquote>Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at UCSB is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. emphasis available to students who wish to develop and use cutting-edge quantitative methods in social science research. Our curriculum is designed to provide students with the rigorous mathematical and statistical background necessary for advanced quantitative work, while also providing a broad interdisciplinary perspective on the use of quantitative methods in the social sciences. A growing number of departments and faculty participate in the emphasis and our weekly colloquia, which features speakers engaged in quantitative research across all social science disciplines.</blockquote>
I recommend any student interested in quantitative analysis in their field check out QMSS.

<strong>Forecast:</strong> Students with a QMSS emphasis will be more marketable than their counterparts without it.
