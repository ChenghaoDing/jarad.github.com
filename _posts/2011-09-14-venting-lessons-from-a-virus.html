A <a href="http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/download.asp?af=h&f=8621036" title="H1N1 experiences" target="_blank">pdf put out by the CDC to describe experiences during the H1N1 outbreak</a> claims 


<blockquote>communicating the experiences of a pandemic can be just as
valuable as exchanging data</blockquote>

I call BS. In a field where data is extremely hard to come by due to HIPAA regulations and insurance companies ``owning'' data, outbreak data is extremely valuable. Certainly it is far more valuable than some selected experiences.
