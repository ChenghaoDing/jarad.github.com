Here is a graph of the cost of a 30-second superbowl ad that I borrowed from the <a title="Big Picture superbowl ad" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/02/the-superbowl-as-an-economic-indicator/" target="_blank">The Big Picture blog</a>. The title of the post there is `The Superbowl As An Economic Indicator'. If it was a good indicator, why the big jump in 2009. Clearly everyone knew that the economy was declining last year, but yet the spending on a 30 second commercial was a larger than expected increase over the previous year.
