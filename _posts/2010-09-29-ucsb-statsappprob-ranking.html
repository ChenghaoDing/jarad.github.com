New National Research Council rankings have come out for the 2005-2006 school year. All the data are available at the <a title="Rankings" href="http://www.nap.edu/rdp/" target="_blank">National Academies Press</a> and can be downloaded for free by providing your email address (link toward bottom of the page). They provide two ranking systems: 1) a regression-based approach where relative to weights to different categories are derived by providing faculty with samples of schools to rate and 2) survey where weights to categories are directly assigned by faculty. Here are the results for the top schools (out of 61 ranked programs) as well as Duke and UCSB since I have a personal connection there.In order to get a single ranked list for each approach, I sorted first by the 5th-percentile and then sub-sorted by the 95-percentile. Frankly I don't know how to even interpret the 5th and 95th-percentiles.

For the regression-based approach:

[1] STANFORD UNIVERSITY
[2] HARVARD UNIVERSITY
[3] UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY
[4] IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY
[5] UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN-ANN ARBOR
[6] NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY
[7] UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON
[8] UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
[9] JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
[10] TEXAS A &amp; M UNIVERSITY
...
[19] DUKE UNIVERSITY
...
[47] UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-SANTA BARBARA


For the survey-weighted approach:

[1] STANFORD UNIVERSITY
[2] HARVARD UNIVERSITY
[3] UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
