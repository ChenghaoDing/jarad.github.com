This is the title of a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/06/scientist_shortage_is_a_myth_.html" title="slate" target="_blank">slate article</a> by a medicinal chemist. He goes on to say:


<blockquote>But there’s an even larger problem with the “more scientists, no matter what” view. In R&D, the rate-limiting step (to use a term from my chemical background) is usually not the number of people working on a problem. Not after a certain point, at any rate. Automation and miniaturization have been changing that, as in so many other industries. We can test more compounds and generate even bigger server-choking piles of data faster than ever before. The problem is figuring out what all of those numbers mean and what they’re telling us to do next. </blockquote>

Right. So we don't need more "scientists", we need more mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.
