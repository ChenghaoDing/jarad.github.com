I have been thinking about posting all the license agreements that I have agreed to and not actually read. I think the state of our legal system is out of date and these agreements are just one symptom. By posting it here, perhaps my readers will alert me when I have agreed to something ridiculous, but I'm not holding my breath. Not because I think I won't agree to something ridiculous, but why should you read my agreements if I don't. 

Below is my first license agreement that must be agreed to in order to register my Garmin nuvi.



<blockquote>myGarminâ„¢ Terms of Use

This document states the Terms and Conditions (the "Terms" or the "Agreement") under which you may use the myGarmin document portal (the "Portal"). As used herein, the term "you" refers to any person, entity, and/or organization granted access to the myGarmin portal. Please read these Terms carefully. By accessing and using the Portal, you accept and agree to be bound, without limitation or qualification, by these Terms. If you do not accept any of the Terms stated here, do not use the Portal. Garmin may, at its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. You are bound by any such modification or revision and should therefore visit this page periodically to review the Terms.

Registration

In order to gain access to the Portal, you will be required to register with Garmin and be approved for access to the Portal. If you are granted access, you will be required enter your username and password before entering the Portal. You may not share your username or password with any third party.

Use of Materials and Confidentiality

Garmin authorizes you to view and download a single copy of certain Materials and documents designated for your viewing on the Portal for the sole purpose as described in the Portal documentation, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. The contents of the Portal, such as posted documents, text, graphics, images, drawings, and other materials (collectively, the "Materials") are the sole and exclusive property of Garmin and may constitute trade secrets or proprietary or confidential information of Garmin (hereinafter "Confidential Materials") if designated as confidential or proprietary by Garmin either in the Materials or in the Portal documentation. You agree not to disclose any of the Materials to any person or entity without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of Garmin, provided that you may disclose necessary portions of the Materials to any of your employees who have a need to receive such Materials for the limited purpose stated in the Portal and who have signed appropriate written agreements sufficient to compel such employee to comply with your confidentiality obligations hereunder. You shall take all necessary reasonable precautions to keep confidential the Materials viewed or downloaded from the Portal and prevent their unauthorized use. You agree to be responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement as to your employees and to take such action, including appropriate legal action, as may be necessary to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Garmin's Materials by such employees.

You agree not to use the Materials to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any products or technology of Garmin. You may not, without the prior written permission of Garmin, "mirror" any Materials contained on the Portal. Further, unauthorized use of the Materials may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws. You shall notify Garmin immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Materials and shall cooperate with Garmin in every reasonable way to help it regain possession of the Materials and prevent any further unauthorized use or disclosure.

Copyright

The copyright in all Materials posted to the Portal is held by Garmin or by the original creator of the Materials. Except as stated herein, none of the Materials may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without the prior written permission of Garmin or the copyright owner.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION APPLIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW.

Export Control

The United States controls the export of products and information. You agree to comply with such restrictions and not to export or re-export the Materials to countries or persons prohibited under the export control laws. By downloading the Materials, you are agreeing that you are not in a country where such export is prohibited and that you are not on the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders or the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals. You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your local jurisdiction regarding the import, export, or re-export of the Materials.

By using this Portal, you agree that the exclusive forum for any claims or causes of action arising out of your use of this Portal is the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, or any Kansas State court sitting in Johnson County.

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
