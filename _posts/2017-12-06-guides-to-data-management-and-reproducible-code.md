> The British Ecological Society has started a series of “Guides to Better Science” documents. They have just published a guide to writing reproducible code. The series also includes a guide to data management, a guide to peer review and a guide to getting published.  The examples are ecological/evolutionary, but the principles apply broadly.  The documents are free and published under a Creative Commons license.   The content can be found many places across the web, but these provide something you can cite that is backed by a reputable scientific society.
