The plot below from the <a title="National Buoy Data Center" href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/tour/virtr5.shtml" target="_self">National Data Buoy Center</a> is from two different stations (no idea where they are located) measuring air pressure. Although the data shown in this plot isn't current, data of this sort would be appropriate for my <a title="PSTAT 262 Project" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/12/forecasting-datasets/" target="_self">PSTAT 262 project</a>. Apparently the upshot of this particular figure was to decide that the buoy at 42043 has a bias in its reporting of air pressure since it is consistently above the air pressure at station 42035. Any reason to think the air pressure might just be consistently higher there? I have no idea, so I guess I will take the analyst word for it.
