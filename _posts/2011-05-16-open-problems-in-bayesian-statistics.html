In a <a title="ISBA bulletin" href="http://members.bayesian.org/sites/default/files/fm/bulletins/1103.pdf" target="_blank">recent bulletin</a> for the <a title="ISBA" href="http://bayesian.org/" target="_blank">International Society for Bayesian Statistics</a>, the new president, <a title="Michael Jordan" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a>, requested responses from top academic Bayesians and asked them what the currently open problems are in Bayesian statistics. As a quick summary, the list is (in Michael Jordan's order):
<ol>
	<li>Model selection and hypothesis testing</li>
	<li>Computation and statistics</li>
	<li>Bayesian/frequentist relationships</li>
	<li>Priors</li>
	<li>Nonparametrics and semiparametrics</li>
</ol>
Some additional discussion by <a title="Andrew Gelman" href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/04/what_are_the_op.html" target="_blank">Andrew Gelman</a> can be found at the <a title="The Statistics Forum" href="http://statisticsforum.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/what-are-the-open-problems-in-bayesian-statistics/" target="_blank">statistics forum</a>. I thought this list and the associated discussion would be useful for graduate students who are entertaining a thesis in Bayesian statistics.
