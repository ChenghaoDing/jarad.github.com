There is an interesting <a title="protest discussion" href="http://www.env-econ.net/2009/11/why-students-protesting-tuition-hikes-in-california-are-wellintentioned-but-misguided.html" target="_blank">discussion</a> over at <a title="Environmental economics" href="http://www.env-econ.net/" target="_blank">Environmental Economics</a> discussing the UC student protests against raising student fees. The economic argument they are making is that if university tuition and fees remain the same while at the same time the university is receiving less state subside then the amount (or quality) of instruction occurring will decrease. They then ask the question: is this really what students want?
