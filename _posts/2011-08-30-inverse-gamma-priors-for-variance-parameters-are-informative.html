I guess I need to go figure out why <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/understanding_h/" title="Andrew Gelamn blog" target="_blank">Gelman says that inverse-gamma priors for variance parameters are informative</a> and therefore suggests (I'm assuming based on my previous post) half-t priors. I guess the answer is in <a href="http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue03/gelman.pdf" title="Andrew Gelamn blog" target="_blank">this paper</a>. And apparently this is implemented in blmer/bglmer in R.
