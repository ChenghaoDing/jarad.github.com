In a follow-up to my <a title="Stewart comments on Olbermann" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2010/01/25/stewart-comments-on-olbermann/" target="_blank">post</a> yesterday pointing out Jon Stewart's special comment on Keith Olbermann. Last night, we had <a title="Olbermann apologizes to Stewart" href="http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/olbermann-responds-to-stewart-youre-right-i-have-been-a-little-over-the-top-lately-point-taken-sorry.php" target="_blank">Olbermann apologize to Stewart</a> for being `a little over the top.' It certainly beats the `I apologize if you misunderstood me' or `I apologize if you feel bad' type of apologies, so that's something.
