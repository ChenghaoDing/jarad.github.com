Here is another example of a possible dataset for analysis in my PSTAT 262 course this winter. For more details about the project, see <a title="PSTAT 262 Project" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/12/forecasting-datasets/" target="_self">here</a>. Unfortunately I was not able to easily incorporate the picture into this post, so you will have to visit the figure at the <a title="U.S. Homeownership Rate" href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/10/q3-record-rental-vacancy-rate.html" target="_blank">Calculated Risk</a> blog.
