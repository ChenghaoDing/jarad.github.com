I published a paper in 2010 in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics titled `<a href="http://pubs.amstat.org/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2010.08117" title="JCGS paper">Adaptive mixture modelling Metropolis methods for Bayesian analysis of non-linear state-space models</a>' and can be obtained here. In the supplemental material I provided <a href='http://jaradniemi.com/2011/08/31/jcgs-code/am4_code/' rel='attachment wp-att-1061'>code</a> as well as another example of the use of this method. My goal with adding the code was to allow people to reproduce the example in the paper. I spent a lot of time trying to make sure the code was complete and accurate, but recently I have received several emails/posts from people who have had difficulties running the code. I am setting this post up to log difficulties and solutions.
