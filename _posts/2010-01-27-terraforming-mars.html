Have you ever thought about the possibility of living on Mars? National Geographic recently put out a time-table for terraforming Mars that it might take about 1,000 years. Even then, humans on Mars would need to use scuba gear to go outside. The basic idea of the terraforming is to release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the martian atmosphere by crashing the planet with meteors to release CO2 or create factories to produce CO2. I wondered about the possibility of transporting CO2 from Earth to Mars, solving two problems at the same time. This doesn't seem likely since transportation to Mars is a huge cost, but perhaps we will create technology that will make that transportation cheaper.
