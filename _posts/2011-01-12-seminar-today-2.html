<a title="Mike Ludkovski" href="http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/faculty/ludkovski/" target="_blank">Mike Ludkovski</a> and I will be giving a joint seminar today in PSTAT (Sobel Room, South Hall 5607F on UCSB campus) at 3:30, refreshments at 3:15. We will be talking about our recent work on optimal control of disease outbreak using an influenza example. It is a hard problem with much work to be done. Come and join us! More information can be found in the <a title="SCID paper" href="http://www.bepress.com/scid/vol2/iss1/art5" target="_blank">published paper</a>.
