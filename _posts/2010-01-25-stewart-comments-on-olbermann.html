As a fan of both Jon Stewart and Keith Olbermann, I really enjoyed this <a title="Stewart comment on Olbermann" href="http://www.indecisionforever.com/2010/01/22/jon-stewarts-special-comment-on-keith-olbermann/" target="_blank">Special Comment</a> by Stewart about recent remarks Olbermann had for the newly elected Senator from Massachusetts. I had seen the Olbermann comments previously and thought they were a bit thin (where's my <a title="Sarcasm emoticon" href="http://mashable.com/2010/01/15/sarcmark/" target="_blank">sarcasm emoticon</a>?) on the supporting facts against senator-elect <a title="Scott Brown" href="http://www.brownforussenate.com/" target="_blank">Scott Brown</a>.
