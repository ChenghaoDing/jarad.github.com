<a title="PSTAT 262 Project" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/12/forecasting-datasets/" target="_self">Previously</a> I have mentioned a plan to have students analyze a data set.Â  <a title="Current housing starts" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/200909-housing-starts.JPG" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting dataset concerning housing starts. From wikipedia, <a title="Housing starts definition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_starts" target="_blank">housing starts</a> "refers to the number of privately owned new homes (technically housing units) on which construction has been started in a given period." This index gives an indication of how the housing market is doing.
