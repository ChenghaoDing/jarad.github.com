I will be giving a seminar today in my department entitled `A sequential Monte Carlo primer.' The idea is to give those who are unfamiliar with the field an introduction. More can be read <a title="A sequential Monte Carlo primer" href="http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/seminars.htm#Niemi" target="_blank">here</a> and obviously can be heard by coming to <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">South Hall 5607F @ 3:15 PM, refreshments available at 3PM.
