I'd like to flesh out my ideas about the different types of models people use. In continuation of a <a title="models" href="http://jaradniemi.com/2011/11/02/models/">previous discussion</a>, Eric writes:
<blockquote>I asked a CS prof that works with simulations/models about the difference between mathematical and statistical models. Â I might be exaggerating a bit... but he seemed to think it was a trivial issue - we should just pick the appropriate model for the problem we are trying to solve with worrying about semantics!</blockquote>
Previously I had defined a statistical model as a generative model for the data. In my definition a mathematical model could be made into a statistical model by adding randomness that allows for the data that are actually observed. For example, a mathematical model could be y=a+bx where y and x are known and a and b are parameters to be estimated. A statistical version (regression) is y=a+bx+e where e is now given a probability distribution, e.g. normal with mean zero and unknown variance. One inferential advantage to the latter is that we can estimate a and b and provide uncertainty about their estimates.

Many people do not worry about this step and just estimate the parameters and treat them as the truth. This will provide overconfidence in any predictions that are being made.
