As discussed in my <a href="https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/assignment/pstat262_blog1.txt">previous blog entry</a>, the analyzed data is that of yearly births for the states of California and Mississippi. These data are available and here presented from 1960 through 2008, with no missing observations. While California exhibits evidence of three birth "booms" over this time period, Mississippi births decline over the decade of the 1960's and enter a state of flux, or "waves," over the following decades. In both states it appears a downward trend is beginning in births. It would be predicted that in the short-term forecast the births in both states will decrease to 550,000 and 42,000 respectively. These numbers are expected to again increase, as the children born in the "boom" of the 1980's begin having children of their own.
