<a title="iPhone decision" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/2009/10/07/another-reason-to-get-an-iphone/" target="_self">Previously</a> I have mentioned I'm in the market to get a new phone. The Motorola Droid is a possible alternative to getting an iPhone. This <a title="Motorola Droid preview" href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/10/23/motorola-droid-preview/" target="_blank">review</a> is pretty enthusiastic and the full specifications can be found <a title="Motorola Droid specs" href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/ci.Motorola-DROID-US-EN.alt" target="_blank">here</a>. What is unclear to me at this point is what plan I will need to have to use the functionality of the Droid. I do not want to pay anymore than I currently am, which only gives me voice and free Verizon In calls (I pay per text message). So I understand I will not be able to use phone features that involve sending data over Verizon's network, but will I be able to take advantage of all the other functionality? I presume yes, but will need to find out before I jump in.
