(Edited on Jan 6, 2010 @ 8:24 - Somehow in my upgrading to wordpress 2.9.0 part of this post got lost. I went to the eula analyzer link and pasted the eula from there.)

User agreement for Windows XP service pack 3. I tried out the suggestion on a previous post of an online eula analyzer. The results can be found <a title="Microsoft Windows XP service pack 3" href="http://www.spywareguide.com/analyze/go.php?key=fb7b481499db464a32bb7984fa29c840&amp;anmode=0" target="_blank">here</a>. One interesting output from this analysis is that the reading level of the analysis is beyond twelfth grade level under all 4 metrics the site uses. So how is a high school graduate supposed to agree to terms that he can't even read? I wonder if this has been tested in the legal system. The second interesting result is the analyzer found two reference to tracking or monitoring: one in section 5 and the other in section 9. So what if I do not agree with these terms? Apparently my only recourse is to not install the service pack. So Microsoft gets to make a poor operating system that I purchase. This OS needs to be updated to maintain maximum functionality and protection against exploits, so I am basically forced to agree to whatever terms they can dream up.
<blockquote>SUPPLEMENTAL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR
MICROSOFT SOFTWARE

MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 3

PLEASE READ THIS SUPPLEMENTAL END-USER
LICENSE AGREEMENT ('SUPPLEMENTAL EULA')
CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING OR USING THE
SOFTWARE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS SUPPLEMENTAL
EULA, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
SUPPLEMENTAL EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO
NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND, IF
APPLICABLE, RETURN IT TO THE PLACE OF
PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND.

1. General

If you acquired the accompanying Microsoft
software from the manufacturer
("Manufacturer") of the computer system or
computer system component ('HARDWARE') with
which you acquired the Microsoft software
product(s) identified on the Certificate of
Authenticity ("COA") affixed to the HARDWARE
or on the associated product documentation,
this Supplemental EULA is a legal agreement
between you (either an individual or a single
entity) and the Manufacturer.

If you acquired the accompanying Microsoft
software from a source other than the
Manufacturer, this Supplemental EULA is a
legal agreement between you (either an
individual or a single entity) and Microsoft
Corporation or one of its affiliates
('Microsoft').

The accompanying Microsoft software includes
computer software and may include associated
media, printed materials, 'online' or
electronic documentation, and Internet-based
services (collectively, the 'OS Components').
The OS Components are provided to update,
supplement, or replace existing functionality
of Microsoft Windows XP Professional Edition
or Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition (the 'OS
Software'). Your use of the OS Components is
subject to the terms and conditions of the
end user license agreement (either from
Microsoft or the Manufacturer) under which
you have previously licensed the OS Software
(the 'OS Software EULA') and this
Supplemental EULA.
Reference to tracking or monitoring.
To the extent that any
terms in this Supplemental EULA conflict with
terms in the applicable OS Software EULA, the
terms of this Supplemental EULA control.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALIDLY LICENSED COPY
OF THE OS SOFTWARE, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO
INSTALL, COPY OR OTHERWISE USE THE OS
COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS
SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.

For purposes of this Supplemental EULA,
references to 'Computer' mean 'Workstation
Computer' or 'COMPUTER' as defined in the OS
Software EULA.

The following license terms describe
additional terms for the OS Software as
supplemented with the OS Components
(collectively, 'SOFTWARE'). The changes
include:

* additional information about the
validation functions of the Software, which
determine whether the software is counterfeit,
improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows
product; and

* additional privacy disclosures about
Internet-based services.
Reference to tracking or monitoring.


This list highlights some of the changes.
The terms below govern your use of the
SOFTWARE.

2. MANDATORY ACTIVATION

Activation associates the use of the
SOFTWARE with a specific computer.During
activation, the SOFTWARE will send
information about the SOFTWARE and the
Computer to Microsoft.This information
includes the version, language and product
key of the SOFTWARE, the Internet protocol
address of the Computer, and information
derived from the hardware configuration of
the Computer.For more information, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=103743.
By using the SOFTWARE, you consent to the
transmission of this information.If properly
licensed, you have the right to use the
version of the SOFTWARE installed during the
installation process up to a period of 30
days permitted for activation.Unless the
SOFTWARE is activated, you have no right to
use the SOFTWARE after the time permitted for
activation.This is to prevent its unlicensed
use.You are not permitted to bypass or
circumvent activation.If the Computer is
connected to the Internet, the SOFTWARE may
automatically connect to Microsoft for
activation.You can also activate the
SOFTWARE manually by Internet or telephone.
If you do so, Internet and telephone service
charges may apply.Some changes to your
computer components or the SOFTWARE may
require you to reactivate the SOFTWARE.The
SOFTWARE will remind you to activate it until
you do.

3. VALIDATION

The SOFTWARE may check periodically whether
a properly licensed copy of the SOFTWARE is
installed.Validation may be required for
certain Microsoft software to be downloaded,
installed or used.If you have a properly
licensed copy of the SOFTWARE installed, you
receive special benefits, see http://go.
microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=39157. If the
software detects that a properly licensed
copy of the SOFTWARE is not installed, you
will receive a notification and periodic
reminders to install a properly licensed copy
of the SOFTWARE.During or after a validation
check, the SOFTWARE may send information
about the SOFTWARE, the device and the
results of the validation check to Microsoft.
This information includes, for example, the
version and product key of the SOFTWARE, any
unauthorized changes made to the validation,
licensing or activation functions of the
SOFTWARE, any related malicious or
unauthorized software found and the Internet
protocol address of the device.Microsoft
does not use the information to identify or
contact you.By using the SOFTWARE, you
consent to the transmission of this
information.For more information about
validation and what is sent during or after a
validation check, see http://go.microsoft.
com/fwlink/?Linkid=96551.

4. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.

Microsoft provides Internet-based services
with the SOFTWARE.It may change or cancel
them at any time.

4.1 Consent for Internet-Based Services.The
software features described below in Section
4.2 and in the Privacy Statement connect to
Microsoft or service provider computer
systems over the Internet.In some cases, you
will not receive a separate notice when they
connect.You may switch off these features or
not use them.For more information about
these features, see the Privacy Statement at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=103743.
By using these features, you consent to the
transmission of this information.Microsoft
does not use the information to identify or
contact you.

4.2 Computer Information.The following
features use Internet protocols, which send
to the appropriate systems computer
information, such as your Internet protocol
address, the type of operating system,
browser and name and version of the software
you are using, and the language code of the
Computer where you installed the SOFTWARE.
Microsoft uses this information to make the
Internet-based services available to you.

?? Plug and Play.You may connect new
hardware to your Computer.Your Computer may
not have the drivers needed to communicate
with that hardware.If so, the update feature
of the software can obtain the correct driver
from Microsoft and install it on your
Computer.An administrator can disable this
update feature.

?? Windows Update.To enable the proper
functioning of the Windows Update service in
the SOFTWARE (if you use it), updates or
downloads to the Windows Update service will
be required from time to time and downloaded
and installed without further notice to you.

?? Web Content Features.Under the SOFTWARE's
default configuration, if you are connected
to the Internet, several features of the
SOFTWARE are enabled by default to retrieve
content from Microsoft computer systems and
display it to you.When you activate such a
feature, it uses standard Internet protocols,
which transmit the type of operating system,
browser and language code of your Computer to
the Microsoft computer system so that the
content can be viewed properly from your
Computer.These features only operate when
you activate them, and you may choose to
switch them off or not use them.Examples of
these features include Windows Catalog,
Search Assistant, and the Headlines and
Search features of Help and Support Center.

?? Digital Certificates.The SOFTWARE uses
digital certificates based on the x.509
standard.These digital certificates confirm
the identity of Internet users sending x.509
standard encrypted information.The software
retrieves certificates and updates
certificate revocation lists.These security
features operate only when you use the
Internet.

?? Auto Root Update.The Auto Root Update
feature updates the list of trusted
certificate authorities.You can switch off
the Auto Root Update feature.

?? Windows Media Player.Some features of
Windows Media Player automatically contact
Microsoft computer systems if you use Windows
Media Player or specific features of it:
features that (A) check for new codecs if
your Computer does not have the correct ones
for content you attempt to play (this feature
may be switched off), and (B) check for new
versions of Windows Media Player (this
feature will operate only when you are using
Windows Media Player). The provisions in this
paragraph do not apply to the KN and N
versions of Microsoft Windows XP SP3 as they
do not include Windows Media Player.

?? Windows Media Digital Rights Management.
Content providers are using the digital
rights management technology for Windows
Media contained in this SOFTWARE ('WM-DRM')
to protect the integrity of their content
("Secure Content") so that their intellectual
property, including copyright, in such
content is not misappropriated.Portions of
this SOFTWARE and third party applications
such as media players use WM-DRM to play
Secure Content ('WM-DRM Software'). If the WM-
DRM Software's security has been compromised,
owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content
Owners") may request that Microsoft revoke
the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display
and/or play Secure Content.Revocation does
not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to
play unprotected content.A list of revoked
WM-DRM Software is sent to your Computer
whenever you download a license for Secure
Content from the Internet.Microsoft may, in
conjunction with such license, also download
revocation lists onto your Computer on behalf
of Secure Content Owners.Secure Content
Owners may also require you to upgrade some
of the WM-DRM components in this SOFTWARE
('WM-DRM Upgrades') before accessing their
content.When you attempt to play such
content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft
will notify you that a WM-DRM Upgrade is
required and then ask for your consent before
the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded.WM-DRM
Software built by third parties may do the
same.If you decline the upgrade, you will
not be able to access content that requires
the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still
be able to access unprotected content and
Secure Content that does not require the
upgrade.WM-DRM features that access the
Internet, such as acquiring new licenses
and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade,
can be switched off.When these features are
switched off, you will still be able to play
Secure Content if you have a valid license
for such content already stored on your
Computer.The provisions in this paragraph do
not apply to the KN and N versions of
Microsoft Windows XP SP3 as they do not
include WM-DRM.

4.3 Use of Information.Microsoft may use
the computer information to improve
Microsoft's software and services.Microsoft
may also share it with others, such as
hardware and software vendors.They may use
the information to improve how their products
run with Microsoft software.

4.4 Misuse of Internet-based Services.You
may not use these services in any way that
could harm them or impair anyone else's use
of them.You may not use the services to try
to gain unauthorized access to any service,
data, account or network by any means.
