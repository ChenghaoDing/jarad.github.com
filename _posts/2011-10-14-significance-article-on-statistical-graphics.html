I recently received the following common on my <a title="About Jarad Niemi" href="http://jaradniemi.com/">About page</a>:
<blockquote>i would deeply appreciate a copy or pdf of your latest article statistical graphics Making information clear â€” and beautiful, published in significance 8(3) 2011

Thanks in advance,

Pablo</blockquote>
First, I have now figured out how to disable comments on pages so that the comments can stay on my blog. Second, the article can now be found on my publications page.

The main purpose of the <a title="Significance magazine" href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/view/index.html" target="_blank">Significance</a> article is to try helping people who are typically using the default settings from R/Excel/anything when creating plots. These plots can typically be made much better very quickly. In the article, we make a few suggestions based on trying to `put yourself in the reader's shoes.'
