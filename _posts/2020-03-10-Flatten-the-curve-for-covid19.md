{% include JB/setup %}

Like many of you, I have been watching the unfolding of the COVID19 pandemic. 
Up until last week, I didn't really understand the problem. 
In fact, I was annoyed at the 
[Iowa Board of Regents](https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-board-of-regents-cancels-all-university-sponsored-international-travel/31248235) 
for canceling my trip to Germany for what seemed like "just another flu".
But now (I think) I understand the severity of the problem. 
So I thought I would share my perspective in case you are also thinking 
"what's the big deal?" 

## Not just the flu

The big deal is that this is a **novel** coronavirus which means that we have 
little to no immunity to it. 
In addition, current best estimates are that the disease is more deadly than the 
flu with a fatality rate of 
[0.5%-4%](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/) compared to 0.1% for flu 
(that's 5-40 times more deadly). 
So it is not "just like the flu" because we have no immunity (or vaccine) and 
it is more deadly.

## Healthcare system overload

More problematic than this is the need for hospitalization for those with 
symptoms severe enough to need treatment. 
In Italy, about [10% of cases need ICU care for 3-6 weeks](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232). 
(Reports out of 
[Italy](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3395152210500625&id=100000176383731) and 
[Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/10/812865169/how-a-south-korean-city-is-changing-tactics-to-tamp-down-its-covid-19-surge) make the effects of this outbreak sound like a war zone.) 
No medical establishment has the capacity to handle this many cases simultaneously. 
THIS IS THE ISSUE!!

In Ames, which has a population of 65,000, our hospital, 
[Mary Greeley Medical Center](https://www.mgmc.org/), has ~220 beds.

Just like us, healthcare workers have no immunity. 
[Personal protective equipment is all on backorder](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/fda-medical-device-mask-hospital-shortage/index.html). 
So, it will be likely that doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff will become 
infected and therefore unable to treat those who are sick for a couple of weeks. 

This overburdening of the healthcare system will be bad for those who have COVID19, 
but it will also be bad for anybody who needs to use the healthcare system for other reasons during that time, e.g. heart attacks, broken bones, giving birth, etc. 

## Flatten the curve

So, what we need to do is 
[#flattenthecurve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/). 
This means we need to stretch the outbreak into a much longer time frame so that 
healthcare can keep up. 
We need to reduce transmissions through a number of means including social distancing. 
I'm betting that Iowa State University will move to online instruction for the remainder of the semester, as [Harvard has done](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-classes-cancelled/).

### Limit travel

Reconsider spring break travel plans. My parents and sister and her family have cancelled their trip to visit us in a week and a half and my daughter was extremely disappointed that her grandparents and cousins were no longer coming to visit, but that is the situation we are in. 

## US compared to the rest of the world

There are reasons to be optimistic and reasons to be pessimistic about what will happen in the US compared to the rest of the world. 
On the positive side, 
[our age distribution](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270000/age-distribution-in-the-united-states/) has fewer older individuals than 
[Italy](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270473/age-distribution-in-italy/)
and [our population is generally more spread apart](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183475/united-states-population-density/)
than in 
[South Korea](https://www.statista.com/statistics/756232/south-korea-population-density/). 
On the negative side, 
our national government has done virtually nothing to 
[stop transmission from abroad](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus),
[is not ](https://twitter.com/haldre1/status/1237227740182519809),
and [has overly restrictive requirements for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)
(generally you need to have been in contact with a confirmed (!) COVID19 case or in China/Italy/Iran/South Korea/Japan).

### Washington state outbreak

University of Washington developed their own test and 
[5-7% of individuals are testing are positive](https://twitter.com/UWVirology/status/1236017803162873856). 
Many of those tested would not have qualified for the CDC's test. 

### Everywhere else

So likely coronavirus is already here (both where I am and where you are), 
but we aren't testing so we don't know. 
Also on the negative side, it seems doubtful we (as a country) have the will to 
institute containment measures like those instituted in 
[China](https://time.com/5781133/china-coronavirus-infections-slowing/) and 
[Italy](https://time.com/5799873/italy-coronavirus-travel-restrictions/). 


## Summary

COVID19 is worse than the flu because we have no immunity, it is 5-40 times 
more deadly, and will quickly overburden our healthcare system treating patients 
with symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized.
