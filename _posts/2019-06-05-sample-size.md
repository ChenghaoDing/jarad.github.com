## Approaches for sample size determination

1. n=3 for each combination of treatments
1. as large as budget allows
1. SE/CI width for quantity of interest
1. power for quantity of interest

CI width depends primarily on the SE while power also depends on a hypothesized
value (or pilot study) for the quantity of interest.
