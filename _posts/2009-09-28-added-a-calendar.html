During my job interviews last winter, somebody mentioned they had created a professional google calendar. The purpose of this calendar was to ease the burden of scheduling appointments with students by allowing students to suggest a time when the instructor was available. I have done the same, although at the moment my free time is abundant. The calendar can be found <a title="My Professional Calendar" href="http://jaradniemi.com/blog/calendar/" target="_self">here</a>.
