I have had a few ideas for inventions. One of them is a digital recipe book with a touchscreen for navigation. Yesterday I decided to search to see if this product exists and sure enough it does. The <a href="http://www.mydemy.com/">Demy</a> is retailing for $300 and from their website

<blockquote>The Demy is the first and only kitchen-safe digital recipe reader that will revolutionize the way you cook. The Demy holds your personal recipe collection in one compact, sleek device. Featuring a high-resolution color touchscreen, an uncluttered interface and many special tools to make any cookâ€™s job easier.</blockquote>

Good features include timers, measurement converters, and substitution suggestions. From reading the comments on amazon, it appears the Demy has a few problems to resolve including the inability to delete the default recipes and any cookbooks and tying the unit to a particular website. I would add to this that the Demy cannot be wall-mounted (as far as I can tell), no wifi, and cannot play music (streaming iTunes would be great). So although this is a step in the right direction it seems a bit pricey for what you get, still I'm happy somebody is working on the product.
