## Time series

The data set discussed today concerned temperatures measured in the open ocean compared to temperatures measured in two sizes of mesocosms: big and small. 
The measured locations, as far as we can determine, were randomly assigned a temperature with no blocking structure. 
Temperatures were measured every 10 minutes over the course of days to weeks.
The main scientific question is whether the big or small mesocosms track the temperature in the open ocean equally well. 

We had many questions about the design of this experiment including 

- location of temperature sensors relative to the mesocosms and
- why are there flat lines for temperature, perhaps imputed missing data or rounding,

but the main question to be addressed here is what to do with a time series when the client has little statistical background.

### Simplify the times series

The main suggested approach is to create statistics from each experimental unit that are scientifically meaningful and perform some relatively simple analyses on these statistics.
For this data set some possible statistics are 

- average across the time series,
- mean absolute error relative to averaged out measurements, and
- average daily range.

The client should be consulted about other relevant statistics that are scientifically meaningful.
