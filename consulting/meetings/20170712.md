## Pig data 

- 6-10 sites each with 50-100 pigs
- site level daily water consumption, environmental, etc
- detect disease (mortality)

Daily water consumption appears to be related to disease, 
i.e. when disease strikes consumption reduces.
But daily water consumption is related to age of pigs at a site and the
temperature.

## Consulting response

- Check out statistical process control (SPC)
- R packages [surveillance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html) and [vetsyn](https://github.com/nandadorea/vetsyn/wiki)
- Considering running regression using log of daily water consumption as the
response and age and temperature (possibly site) as explanatory variables and
then run the SPC procedures on the residuals.
