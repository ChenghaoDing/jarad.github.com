## Differences in word frequency between two corpus

A client has 2 different corpora, say A and B, and is interested in differences
in word frequencies (amongst ~100 words) between the corpora. 

The client is performing bootstrapping on residuals or something.

## Advice

A permutation/randomization tests seems like the most straightforward approach.
In this approach, the corpora identification would be randomly assigned to a 
document and this would be repeated.
Then the statistic would be calculated under this null hypothesis that the 
corpora identification has no relation to word frequency.
