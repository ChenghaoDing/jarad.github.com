## Design for metagenomic analysis

The scientist is interested in understanding antibiotic resistance in a field.
Each sample from the field will be subsampled, each subsample given an 
antibiotic and the survival proportion measured.
The main question is how to sample from the field. 

It appears that some characteristics of the field are important, e.g. elevation, 
slope, soil type, soil moisture, etc. 
The field has been split into 8 (?) strata and 9 samples per strata can be 
taken. 

## Suggestions

- Develop a scientific question to drive the design
- GRTS sampling for spatially-spread points [R::spsurvey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spsurvey/index.html)
