## Cyclical correlation structure

An RNAseq experiment is run with two genotypes with 4 pigs per genotype and 
samples are collected at times 0, 2, 6, and 24 hours after injection of a 
pathogen. 

The question is about what correlation structure to use when we expect that 
gene response will likely be related at times 0 and 24 hours due to the 
circadian rhythm. 

## Thoughts

Try an unstructured covariance matrix, but we don't really have enough 
observations to estimate this covariance matrix.

Try a correlation structure like 

- $\gamma \rho^|s-t|$ where $s$ and $t$ are the two time-points
- (0,24): $\gamma$, (0,2): $\rho^2$, (2,24): $\gamma\rho^2$
- $\gamma \rho^|u,v|$ where $u$ and $v$ are 0 for 24 hours and 1 for 6 hours, 
but 0 and 2 hours are optimized by maximizing over all possible choices amongst
all genes

Obviously a consulting solution is to eliminate the temporal structure by 
taking an average or taking differences, etc.
