## Interpretation of spline basis coefficients

A client has a single explanatory variable and is running a non-parametric 
regression model using spline basis functions. 
The question is whether you can interpret the coefficients for those functions.

### Response

No, (generally) it does not seem useful to interpret the spline basis 
function coefficients.
