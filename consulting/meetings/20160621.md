## Prediction

Consider a scenario with 

- N observations
- P predictors (explanatory variables)

possibly with some grouping structure that we would typically associate with random effects. 

Now, suppose the scientific question is to build the best predictive model.

### Options

There are many options to choose from including

- Stepwise model selection (AIC, BIC, pvalue, etc)
- Model averaging (AIC, BIC, etc)
- LASSO
- Random forest

Stepwise model selection has severe problems and is not suggested. 

Amongst these, the random forest is the preferred methodology. In R, the [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) is on CRAN.
