## Split-plot design

Consider [Figure 2A](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n3/full/nmeth.3293.html) 
where the whole plot is mouse and randomly receives drug (light or dark),
and a subplot that is the different tissue (A or B) in the mouse.

QUESTION: When the split-plot is not randomized, 
can we call this a split-plot design?

## Comments

- It is not clear there is a standard definition of split-plot design that 
requires the subplot to be randomized. 
- When analyzing data collected in this manner a split-plot design seems 
reasonable, although we may be concerned about a negative correlation between 
the two samples within a mouse.
- We could also calculate differences within each mouse and analyze the 
differences as a completely randomized design.

## Hills Criteria

We also discussed non-statistical methods for determining cause-and-effect
relationships. 
Specifically, we discussed [Hills Criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria) for causation
and its application to [Zika](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338).
