This page is dedicated to helping newer faculty understand what the tenure process timeline is in the Statistics department. 
I am creating this page as I go through the process. 
All dates are approximations based on deadlines I was given. 

This process starts at the end of your 5th year unless you were given an extension or are going up earlier. 
The departmental P&T committee will likely meet the week after finals week to set a timeline and determine who your contact is. 

## List of 5 reviewer names (23 May)

The first thing the contact will want is a list of 6 reviewer names from you. 
The departmental P&T committee will come up with their own list and, I believe, 3 names are chosen from each list. 
These individuals are contacted and asked if they agree to be a reviewer. 
If they decline, I assume others are pulled from the two lists. 

The reviewers are expected to be full professors from [Peer Institutions](http://www.ir.iastate.edu/peers.html) or better. To determine what institutions qualify 'or better', use the [Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Eduation](http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu), click on LOOKUP to search for the particular institution if the Category includes 'Better Doctoral Universities: Highest Research Activity' you should be okay to use a reviewer from that school.
