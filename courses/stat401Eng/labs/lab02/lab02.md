Probability distributions in R
------------------------------

Many of the standard probability distributions have functions in R to calculate:

-   cumulative distribution function (p)
-   probability density/mass function (d)
-   quantile function (q)
-   random draws (r)

The letter after each indicates the letter the function will start with for all distributions.

\#\#\# Uniform distribution

The uniform distribution is one of the easiest distributions to understand. If Y is a random variable and it is uniformly distributed between a and b, then we write \(Y \sim Unif(a,b)\).
